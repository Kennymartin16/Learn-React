# React + Vite

This is a React Blogging app whereby you can save what you have in thought into a local database created using a JSON format, it is easily accessible and made easy that you can store and delete inormation from the app.
I implemented this using JSON Server, React Routing, Router links, React custom hook.
Other things done was adding a Handling Fetch Error, making a POST request to the JSON server, Deleting Blogs and adding an Error Boundary page also known as Error 404 page tat catches an incorrect routing page.
